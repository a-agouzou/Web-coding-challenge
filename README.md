# Web Coding Challenge (full stack)

## Don't use AI ðŸš¨
If you want to risk using it, use it in a clever way that make your code clean and readable 

## Idea of the App 
Build a simple "To-Do List" application with an admin panel.  This app will allow users to manage a list of tasks. 
The admin panel will provide the interface to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD operations) these tasks.  
Each task should have a title (required) and a completion status (e.g., "Pending" or "Completed").

## Technologies to Use

*   **MERN Stack:**
    *   **MongoDB:** The database to store product data.  Consider using MongoDB Atlas for easy setup.
    *   **Express.js:** The back-end framework for creating the API endpoints.
    *   **React.js:** The front-end JavaScript library for building the user interface.
    *   **Node.js:** The JavaScript runtime environment.

## Deliverables
